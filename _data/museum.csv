From the laudatory poem he composed for each horse, the names and attributes of the horses can be matched to the stone reliefs. The relief shown here depicts the horse called Saluzi, ridden by Taizong at the battle for the city of Luoyang, the Eastern Capital, in 621 CE. When the horse was stuck with an arrow, the emperor was forced to dismount and switch horses with his general, Qiu Xinggong.

obj10,297875.jpg,Asian,On Display,"The origins of the Penn Museum's crystal ball, both the location where the crystal was mined, and the place where the sphere was polished, are unknown. It was purchased in 1927 from The Far East Shop, a fine arts division specializing in objects made of special gems inside the Wanamaker's department store in Philadelphia. It was given as a gift to the Penn Museum in memory of George Byron Gordon, the director of the museum at the time, who had recently passed away. It came with the name ""Dowager Empress"" attached to it, named after the Empress Dowager Cixi who ruled over China's last Dynasty. However, no evidence has ever come to light that connects the sphere with the Empress, or any other account of the sphere's origins. The silver stand, in the shape of a wave, was made in Japan, and may have been made to order after the sphere was purchased.
 
 It is the fourth largest crystal sphere in the world, with a diameter of 25.4 cm, and weighing 49 lbs. Two spheres in the Smithsonian (32.7 cm) and (27.6 cm) and the Crow Collection in Dallas (28.9 cm) are larger.

It was excavated in the area of the sacred enclosure of the temple of the god Ptah at Memphis, Egypt. The sphinx, a lion with a human head, represents the power of the Egyptian king, both to protect his people and to conquer the enemies of Egypt. This statue was buried up to its shoulders; only the exposed head was attacked by windblown sand, which eroded the facial features and the royal false beard. The inscriptions on the chest and around the base give the five names of Ramses II. His son and successor, Merenptah, added his own cartouches to the shoulders after his father's death. This sphinx, the the largest in the Western hemisphere, was quarried at Aswan and transported by river to the Ptah Temple at Memphis, 600 miles away.

 One of Queen Puabi's wreaths. There are 20 gold (poplar) leaves, separated by two strands of carnelian and lapis beads. Each leaf is one piece of gold hammered out so that the attachment section folds over itself into two loops, which serves as a double joiner for those two strands of beads. The pattern for the beads is true for the beginning/end as well as in between each leaf. One small carnelian ring, a barrel lapis, a carnelian ring, a barrel laps, and ending with a carnelian ring. After the third leaf, from the right, when placed upright, the pattern breaks as the first two carnelian rings are missing. Also, after the 16th leaf, there is only 1 carnelian bead. In two cases the upper string doesn't go through the upper holes due to the bending being loose, and the string slipped out There are a total of 123 carnelian beads and 84 lapis beads.
 
 The two cuneiform signs that compose her name were initially read as ""Shub-ad"" in Sumerian. Today, however, we think they should be read in Akkadian as ""Pu-abi.""",Wreath,Gold|Lapis Lazuli|Carnelian,Iraq|Ur,U.10935a,Field No SF,,,,Early Dynastic III,2600-2450 BCE,-2600,-2450,,,,,74,7.9,0.8,,,,158826,"British Museum/University Museum Expedition to Ur, Iraq, 1928","[Book] Chi, Jennifer, et al. 2015.

 Romano: ""Inscribed rectangular loculus slab with richly ornamented female figure in high relief. Woman is in frontal position with right arm bent and crossed over in front of body at waist height grasping the edge of her mantle. The left arm is bent and is raised to grasp the edge of the veil at shoulder height. She wears a tunic with a mantle fastened with a large circular jeweled brooch at the left shoulder and looped over her bare right forearm. She also wears a veil over the top of her head, the edge of which is scalloped and falls down the right side of the chest. Beneath the veil she wears a high, rolled turban with patterns in relief of rosettes, dots and narrow bands. 
 
 Attached at the front of the turban is a pin with a rectangle linked to an oval jewel with three drops pendant on the forehead. Around her head she also wears a hair chain with circular jewels linked to each other. She wears drop earrings with a deeply drilled separation from the cheek. She wears four necklaces: the uppermost is rolled with a circular pendant; the second a chain with a circular pendant; the third beaded with a circular pendant; and the fourth and lowest a thick chain with a large oval pendant (with a representation of an oval stone in the center and small stones along the perimeter) with four suspended chains with drops on the ends, of the same type as worn at the center of the head ornament. She wears a thick spiral bracelet with studded decoration on each wrist, and a ring with a circular jeweled bezel on the little finger of her left hand. The left hand is poorly executed, while more attention is paid to the right with the fingernails represented. 
 
 The face is rectangular with broad planes for cheeks. The hair is drawn back and up in individual wavy locks. The broadly arching eyebrows are incised; the almond-shaped eyes are prominent with thickened upper lids overlapping the lower; protruding irises incised around the perimeter and with dark pigment. The nose is long and straight with deeply incised nostrils; an indentation separates the nose from the small mouth; finely shaped lips with gouges at the outer corners. Top of head is roughly finished. Inscription to viewer's right of head is false and was probably added in the 19th c. Back of relief is roughly finished with concavity in center.""",Mortuary Statue,Limestone,Syria|Palmyra,CBS8904|P263721,Other Number|CDLI Number,Roman,,,,,,,Woman|Inscription,,High Relief,50,,,,,,,288382,"Babylonian Expedition to Nippur II, 1890","[Book] Dorling Kindersley Limited. 2014.
