description: Ainu woman's formal coat, ruunpe (????). This coat was tailored with
  a number of different materials. The cotton cloth around the waist was most likely
  imported from Honshu, the largest island of Japan. The central back panel, with
  silk cloth applique and nettle thread (irakusa) stitching is very old, possibly
  200-300 years. The sleeves and middle band are later additions. The applique is
  more in the style of Volcano Bay.
