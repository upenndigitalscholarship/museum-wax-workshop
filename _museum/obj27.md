description: "Shubad, now Puabi.\n CBS Register: Queen Shubad's headdress. third crown.
  20 gold leaves. two strings of lapis and carnelian. gold comb CBS 16693.\n \n One
  of Queen Puabi's wreaths. There are 20 gold (poplar) leaves, separated by two strands
  of carnelian and lapis beads. Each leaf is one piece of gold hammered out so that
  the attachment section folds over itself into two loops, which serves as a double
  joiner for those two strands of beads. The pattern for the beads is true for the
  beginning/end as well as in between each leaf. One small carnelian ring, a barrel
  lapis, a carnelian ring, a barrel laps, and ending with a carnelian ring. After
  the third leaf, from the right, when placed upright, the pattern breaks as the first
  two carnelian rings are missing. Also, after the 16th leaf, there is only 1 carnelian
  bead. In two cases the upper string doesn't go through the upper holes due to the
  bending being loose, and the string slipped out There are a total of 123 carnelian
  beads and 84 lapis beads.\n \n The two cuneiform signs that compose her name were
  initially read as \"Shub-ad\" in Sumerian. Today, however, we think they should
  be read in Akkadian as \"Pu-abi.\""
