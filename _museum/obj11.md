description: Gilt bronze statuette of Guanyin. Tall graceful figure standing holding
  lotus bud in hands. Over the forehead at the base of the high crown headdress is
  a tiny figure of the Amida Buddha. When acquired, the statue was covered with a
  thick emerald green patina except for the hands, face and throat which retained
  their smooth gilding; there were traces of gold on the garments. The statue has
  since been cleaned. Found in a river near the Aipao village which was the ancient
  seat of the Jianning Monastery; the village is a suburb of Liaoyang, south of Shenyang
  in Liaoning Province.
