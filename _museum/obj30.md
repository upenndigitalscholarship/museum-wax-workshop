description: Cloak consisting of bundles of yellow, red, and black feathers tied in
  overlapping rows to a netted foundation made of plant fibers. Mainly red, with wide
  yellow border at bottom and yellow diamonds arrayed over the entire surface. Feather
  cloaks ('ahu 'ula) were an essential part of aristocratic regalia in ancient Hawai'i.
  They were made and worn only by men. The feathers are red - the color of aristocrats
  and gods - and rare, highly prized yellow.
