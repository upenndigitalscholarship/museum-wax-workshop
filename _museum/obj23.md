  bronze, one of which, slightly larger, is folded over the edge of the other along
  outer margin of crest and behind large protruding rivets beneath the crest. Oblong
  rectangular pieces riveted over the joints for greater strength where strain was
  heaviest. Nine rivets fasten each of the re-inforcements, 3 protruding ornamental
  rivets in center, 3 plain on either side. Decoration of crest: lines and rows of
  dots of various sizes arranged around a large central boss.'
