description: Funerary mask (tatanua). Carved wooden face surmounted by large semi-circular
  headdress of trade cloth and plant fiber. Eyes of sea snail opercula. Red, black
  and white pigment. Helmet mask worn by male dancers in performances at large scale,
  clan-sponsored multi-village mortuary celebrations. The crest of fiber “hair” may
  refer to a tradition in which, as part of mortuary observances, young men shaved
  the sides of their heads, which were then covered with a plaster of powdered lime.
  The two sides of a mask always differ, and the line of dancers turns to display
  each in turn.
