description: 'Baby carrier, for carrying baby on back. Of woven rattan with wooden
  seat, plaited rattan peel shoulder straps. Inside lined with pink cotton trade cloth.
  Outside covered with red trade cloth and a panel with the Kayan aso (dragon dog)
  motif in yellow and black beads. Across the top and down the sides of the beaded
  panel four large and six small conus shell discs with large yellow beads and short
  strings of yellow and black beads in the centers. Bunches of dangling charms: seed
  pods, large snail shells, and small brown snail shells. When the baby''s umbilical
  cord falls off it is placed in one of the large snail shells, which are often attached
  in pairs for the pleasant noise they make rattling against each other.'
