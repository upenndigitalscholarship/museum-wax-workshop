description: Red granite Sphinx of Ramses II, (19th Dynasty, circa 1293-1185 BCE).
  It was excavated in the area of the sacred enclosure of the temple of the god Ptah
  at Memphis, Egypt. The sphinx, a lion with a human head, represents the power of
  the Egyptian king, both to protect his people and to conquer the enemies of Egypt.
  This statue was buried up to its shoulders; only the exposed head was attacked by
  windblown sand, which eroded the facial features and the royal false beard. The
  inscriptions on the chest and around the base give the five names of Ramses II.
  His son and successor, Merenptah, added his own cartouches to the shoulders after
  his father's death. This sphinx, the the largest in the Western hemisphere, was
  quarried at Aswan and transported by river to the Ptah Temple at Memphis, 600 miles
  away. While it has never been placed on a scale, it is estimated to weigh just under
  13 tons.
